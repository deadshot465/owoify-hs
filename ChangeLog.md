# Changelog for owoify-hs

## 1.1.0.0
**This version changed some mappings in presets, so the same input probably won't return the same result as version 1.0.0.1**

- Add more word mappings so it's on par with mohan-cao's latest owoify.
- Add uwuify and uvuify for convenience.

## 1.0.0.1
- Remove executable and move HUnit to test-only dependency.

## 1.0.0.0
- Initial release.
