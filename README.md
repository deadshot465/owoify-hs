# owoify-hs

Turning your worst nightmare into a Haskell package.

[![Haskell CI](https://github.com/deadshot465/owoify-hs/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/deadshot465/owoify-hs/actions/workflows/haskell.yml)

This is a Haskell port of [mohan-cao's owoify-js](https://github.com/mohan-cao/owoify-js), which will help you turn any string into nonsensical babyspeak similar to LeafySweet's infamous Chrome extension.

Just like my other Owoify ports, three levels of owoness are available. Each level has been implemented using a discriminated union, so it should work like enums people are used to seeing in other imperative languages.

1. **owo (default)**: The most vanilla one.
2. **uwu**: The moderate one.
3. **uvu**: Litewawwy unweadabwal.
Please refer to the original [owoify-js repository](https://github.com/mohan-cao/owoify-js) for more information.

Functional programming is fun, so of course I'll port it to FP languages. üòú

Also I love Haskell. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Reason for development

Because I love Haskell and currently Hackage doesn't have any owoify package yet. Also PureScript is influenced by Haskell and they have nearly the same syntax, so it doesn't make sense to have a PureScript port while not having a Haskell port.

The difference is that owoify-hs makes use of Haskell's lazy evaluation. `Data.Text.Lazy` is used instead of `Data.Text`. This *possibly* solved stack overflow problem with purescript-owoify when owoifying very long texts (i.e. chapter 1-20 of Tolstoy's *War and Peace*). The reason for using `Data.Text.Lazy.Text` instead of the good old `String` is because `Data.Text.Lazy.Text` and the eager version `Data.Text.Text` are meant for handling Unicode texts.

Having said that, you would need to do `Data.Text.Lazy.pack <text>` before passing the text to the `owoify` function.

## Install instructions

Add `owoify-hs` to your `package.yaml` in your Stack project:

```yaml
dependencies:
- owoify-hs == 1.0.0
```

If you are using Cabal, add the package the usual way.

```bash
cabal install owoify-hs
```

## Usage

owoify-hs is implemented as a single function. You will need to provide a source string and a owoify level. Due to random number generator and regular expressions, the result will be inside `IO` monad, so you will also need to handle that.

```haskell
module MyAwesomeModule where

import Prelude

import Data.Owoify.Owoify (OwoifyLevel(..), owoify)
import Data.Text.Lazy (pack, unpack)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  owoResult <- owoify (pack "This is the string to owo! Kinda cute, isn't it?") Owo
  uvuResult <- owoify (pack "This is the string to owo! Kinda cute, isn't it?") Uvu
  -- `print` won't print out Unicode emojis correctly.
  putStrLn $ unpack owoResult
  putStrLn $ unpack uvuResult

-- Possible outputs:
-- This is teh stwing two owo! Kinda cute, isn't it?
-- fwis is teh stwing two owowouvu Kinda cuteowo isn't it?
```

## Disclaimer

As usual, I'm writing this package for both practicing and bots' needs. Performance is **NOT** guaranteed.

That being said, `Data.Text.Lazy` is used, so it should be able to handle both short texts and long texts without any problem.
